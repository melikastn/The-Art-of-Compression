# The-Art-of-Compression
Recreates a given image with a blocky effect. The precomputed support structure allows for necessary statistics to be computed in constant time.

Implemented an algorithm that creates a binary tree of the given image  and prunes it depending on desired tolerance or number of desired blocks.

I was responsible for implementing stats.cpp and twoDtree.cpp
